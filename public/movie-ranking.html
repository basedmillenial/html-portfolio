<h1>The Best Movies According to Tom</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Pianist</h3>
<p>It's a beautiful story of one man's despair, hope, and will to survive.</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>The special effects are rad.</p>
<p>"Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light."</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>Probably the most memorable performance by an antihero of all time.</p>
<p>"I believe that whatever doesn’t kill you, simply makes you—stranger."</p>
